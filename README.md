# Ecommerce
Utilized SQL in Google BigQuery to write and execute queries to find the desired data
## I. Introduction
This project contains an eCommerce dataset that I will explore using SQL on Google BigQuery. The dataset is based on the Google Analytics public dataset and contains data from an eCommerce website.

## II. Requirements
Google Cloud Platform account
Project on Google Cloud Platform
Google BigQuery API enabled
SQL query editor or IDE
## III. Dataset Access
The eCommerce dataset is stored in a public Google BigQuery dataset. To access the dataset, follow these steps:
- Log in to your Google Cloud Platform account and create a new project.
- Navigate to the BigQuery console and select your newly created project.
- In the navigation panel, select "Add Data" and then "Search a project".
- Enter the project ID "bigquery-public-data.google_analytics_sample.ga_sessions" and click "Enter".
- Click on the "ga_sessions_" table to open it.
## IV. Exploring the Dataset
In this project, I will write 08 query in Bigquery base on Google Analytics dataset. Please see the coding file attached above
## V. Conclusion
- In conclusion, my exploration of the eCommerce dataset using SQL on Google BigQuery based on the Google Analytics dataset has revealed several interesting insights.
- By exploring eCommerce dataset, I have gained valuable information about total visits, pageview, transactions, bounce rate, and revenue per traffic source,.... which could inform future business decisions.
- To deep dive into the insights and key trends, the next step will visualize the data with some software like Power BI,Tableau,...
- Overall, this project has demonstrated the power of using SQL and big data tools like Google BigQuery to gain insights into large datasets.
